# BACnet/IP interface

## Notice

While this add-on is intended to add BACnet functionality to Home Assistant, there are some issues with it on Home Assistant OS.

Therefore, **this addon is only supported on a _Supervised_ Home Assistant installation.** 

This means any issues you'll get while using Home Assistant OS can't be solved.

I've tried developing it for Home Assistant OS, but the Who Is and I Am broadcasts never got sent out of the add-on container.
